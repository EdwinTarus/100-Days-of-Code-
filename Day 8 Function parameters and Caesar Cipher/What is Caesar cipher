The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique where each letter in a plaintext message is shifted by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. Named after Julius Caesar, who is said to have used this method, it’s one of the oldest known ciphers.

How It Works
Shift: Each letter in the message is replaced by a letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3:

A → D
B → E
C → F
...
X → A
Y → B
Z → C
Encryption: To encrypt a message, substitute each letter according to the shift.

Decryption: To decrypt, simply reverse the process by shifting in the opposite direction.

Example of Caesar Cipher with a Shift of 3
Plaintext: "HELLO"
Shift: 3
Ciphertext: "KHOOR"
