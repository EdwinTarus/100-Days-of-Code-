"""
The "Higher or Lower" game is a guessing game where players are presented with two options and must guess which one has a higher number of a particular metricâ€”in this case, Instagram followers. 
For each round, a new account is shown alongside the previous one, and players guess whether it has more or fewer followers. Correct guesses keep the game going, while a wrong guess ends it, 
challenging players to reach the highest streak possible.
