In programming, scope refers to the context in which variables, functions, and objects are accessible or visible. The scope determines the part of the code where a particular variable or function can be used or referenced. There are primarily two main types of scope:

Local Scope:

A variable has a local scope when it is declared within a function or a block (e.g., inside a loop or conditional statement).
Variables with local scope are only accessible within the block or function where they are defined. Once the function or block is exited, these variables are no longer available.
Example:
python
def my_function():
    local_var = 10  # This variable has local scope.
    print(local_var)  # Can be accessed here within the function.

my_function()
# print(local_var)  # This would raise an error because local_var is not defined outside the function.

Global Scope:

A variable has a global scope when it is declared outside of any function or block.
Global variables are accessible from any part of the program, including inside functions and blocks (unless shadowed by a local variable with the same name).
Example:
python
global_var = 20  # This variable has global scope.

def another_function():
    print(global_var)  # Can be accessed here because it has global scope.

another_function()
print(global_var)  # Can also be accessed outside the function.

Key Differences:
Local scope variables are limited to the function/block they are declared in, while global scope variables are accessible throughout the entire code.
Local scope helps avoid unintended interference with variables in other parts of the code, which enhances modularity and reduces bugs.
Use global scope variables with caution, as they can be modified from anywhere in the program, which might lead to unexpected behavior.
