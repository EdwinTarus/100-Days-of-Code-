Blackjack is a popular card game typically played between one or more players and a dealer. The objective is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the game works:

1. Card Values
Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points each.
Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the hand the most.
2. Game Setup
Each player is dealt two cards, and the dealer is dealt two cards (one face up and one face down).
Players can see their own cards and the dealer's face-up card.
3. Player Choices
Players have several options:

Hit: Take another card to try to get closer to 21.
Stand: Keep their current hand and end their turn.
Double Down: Double their bet and take exactly one more card (usually allowed only as the first decision after receiving their initial cards).
Split: If the initial two cards are of the same value, the player can split them into two separate hands (each with its own bet).
4. Winning Conditions
Blackjack: If the initial two cards total 21 (e.g., Ace + 10-point card), it is called a Blackjack, which usually wins 1.5x the bet unless the dealer also has a Blackjack.
Bust: If a player's or dealer's hand exceeds 21, they go bust and automatically lose.
Comparison: If neither the player nor the dealer busts, the hand closest to 21 wins. A tie (both having the same score) usually results in a push, where the player's bet is returned.
5. Dealer's Rules
The dealer must hit until their hand totals at least 17. This rule can vary slightly based on house rules (e.g., some casinos require the dealer to hit on a "soft 17," which includes an Ace counted as 11).
6. Payouts
Winning a standard hand typically pays 1:1.
Winning with a Blackjack pays 3:2 (varies by house rules).
Insurance, a side bet against the dealer having Blackjack, pays 2:1 but is usually considered unfavorable for the player.
